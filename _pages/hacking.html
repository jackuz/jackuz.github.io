<p>
   These are some of the security advisories I published during the last
   years. Most of them were released on BugTraq, my blog or on
   <a href="https://github.com/ud2/advisories">this</a> repository.
</p>

<div id="cust__hacking">
  {% for advisory in site.data.advisories %}
  <article>
    <h3>{{ advisory.title }}</h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 1em;">
      <img src="{{ advisory.img }}" align="left" style="padding-right: 1em;">
      {{ advisory.abstract }}
      <br><br>
      Read more <a href="{{ advisory.link }}"><b>here</b></a>.
    </p>
  </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
