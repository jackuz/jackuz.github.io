#In partiular 

From late 2010 to 2016, I worked as a IT Senior Security Consultant at
[Emaze](http://blog.emaze.net/), a security company based in Milan, Italy. Here
my activities included presales, penetration testings, and training courses.

On July 12, 2010, I got my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from
[Università degli Studi di Milano](http://www.unimi.it/) with a final grade of
110/110. The work I did for my M.Sc. thesis is titled "Dynamic analysis of 
web application" ([Thesis](/pubs/lgiancane-msc-thesis.pdf), in Italian |
[Presentation](/pubs/lgiancane-msc-thesis-slides.pdf), in Italian).
